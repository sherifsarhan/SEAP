                        Lydia was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt and moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003. She graduated from Georgia State University in 2014 with a Bachelor’s degree in Public Policy, concentrating in Nonprofit Leadership and minoring in Psychology. Upon graduating, she returned to Cairo to volunteer with various nonprofits and an orphanage. She also used the opportunity to film and co-produce a documentary on the general sense of hopelessness many feel about the country’s state, yet the select few individuals that arise above such hopelessness and work for a better society. After five months in Cairo, Lydia conducted an internship at a nonprofit in Washington, D.C, and is currently preparing for her graduate studies at Columbia University, NYC for a Master’s in International Affairs, concentrating in Humanitarian Policy and Human Rights. When not traveling, eating, or hiking mountains, she enjoys reading particularly on human rights issues in the Middle East.
